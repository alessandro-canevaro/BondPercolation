# BondPercolation

- Development of analytical techniques to identify and characterize the robustness of complex networks to meta-data based interventions on their links.

- Simulation of the percolation process for different network families (Erdos-RÃ©nyi, scale-free, etc.). 

- Understanding the impact of the network's topological parameters on the statistical descriptors of percolation (size of the giant component, distribution of small components, etc.).
